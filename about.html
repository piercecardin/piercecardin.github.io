    Hello There!
    <br>
    <br>
    My name is Pierce Cardin. I am a 15-year old sophomore in highschool, and I make videogames! (Also apparently
    websites, you're looking at one I made)
    <br>
    <br>
    I began programming from a young age, due to my Father's job, starting with Java. I created a small 2D game engine
    (sadly lost, as many projects from being 7-years old have been) that supported input, player movement, and animation
    with sprite sheets. This led to a fascination with computers that has led me to what I am today.
    <br>
    <br>
    As I got older, I realized that re-inventing the wheel was not ideal. I looked into other game engines, and started
    developing small 2D projects in Unity. Due to the syntax of Java and C# being similar, and also due to my quick
    learning, I easily picked up C# and other forms of C.
    <br>
    <br>
    Due to my thirst for more knowledge (and because Unity is not ideal for 2D games) I picked up a piece of software
    known as GameMaker: Studio. This software was amazing for making 2D games, and I began work on an ongoing project. I
    learned JavaScript, animation, art, and learned better convention for organization.
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, I am working on a 2D platformer, handling game design, level creation (due to the metroid-vania style, it
    is open world, yet guided at the same time) art, animation, and even sound design using Famitracker and other forms
    of audio software.
